### Lab 3:  Age-Depth Models

### Things to Do Before Class

#### Ensure that *clam*, *rbacon*, and *Bchron* packages are installed in your R environment

#### Read Two Papers:
(All readings available in  [WiscBox](https://uwmadison.box.com/s/6gv01f8tfuki173oxqk9z57mytcf2lwq))

1. Bronk Ramsey, C. (2008) Radiocarbon dating:  Revolutions in understanding. Archaeometry 50:249-275. *A good overview of radiocarbon fundamentals and interpretation for a general audience.*

2. Blaauw, M. (2010) Methods and code for 'classical' age-modelling of radiocarbon sequences. Quaternary Geochronology 5:512-518.  *Good overview and code for 'classic' age-depth modeling:  linear interpolation, regression, polynomial regression, splines, etc.*


#### Other Good Readings
Grimm, E. C., Blaauw, M., Buck, C. E., and Williams, J. W. (2014) Age models, chronologies, and databases workshop: Complete report and recommendations. PAGES Workshop Report 22. *A discussion of how to best define, represent, and store age controls, age inferences, and age-depth models in paleodatabases such as Neotoma.  Includes a useful definition of key concepts*

Blaauw, M., and Christen, J. A. (2011) Flexible paleoclimate age-depth models using an autoregressive gamma process. Bayesian Analysis 6:1-18.  *Introduces the *bacon* age-depth model and an approach to Bayesian inference.  We'll come back to Bayesian age-depth models later in the semester.*
