# Geography523
This repository holds instructional materials for Geography920/523:  Advanced Paleoecology

It seeks to provide graduate students in the geosciences with a full back-to-front training in paleoecological databases, software resources, and analyses, primarily relying on R, GitHub, various R packages, and the [Neotoma Paleoecology Database](https://www.neotomadb.org).

This repository was initially developed in Fall 2018 by Jack Williams and Mathias Trachsel at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The repository and its contents are also indebted to Simon Goring and others developing training and workshop materials for the Neotoma Paleoecology Database.
