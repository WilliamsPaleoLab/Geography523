# Geography523
This repository holds instructional materials for Geography920/523:  Advanced Paleoecology

It seeks to provide graduate students in the geosciences with a full back-to-front training in paleoecological databases, software resources, and analyses, primarily relying on R, GitHub, various R packages, and the [Neotoma Paleoecology Database](https://www.neotomadb.org).

This repository was initially developed in Fall 2018 by Mathias Trachsel (lectures 6,7, 9 - 13) and Jack Williams at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.  The repository and its contents are also indebted to Simon Goring and others developing training and workshop materials for the Neotoma Paleoecology Database. Mathias Trachsel based his lectures on material by Steve Juggins, Guillaume Blanchet, Lasse Ruokolainen Richard Telford and Joe Chipperfield. Discussions with Tanjona Ramiadantsoa greatly improved the lectures. Jack Williams did **not** contribute to lectures 6, 7 and 9 - 13.
