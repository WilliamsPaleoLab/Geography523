##### Git and Github
Increasingly, science is team science as is software development.  How to control code if two people are working on it at the same time and if a change introduced by one person might be a bug or otherwise alter code that the other person is also developing?  Many systems exist for group editing and sharing of documents (e.g. Google Drive and Docs, Microsoft OneDrive, DropBox, WiscBox) but more careful systems are needed when sharing and co-developing code.

Git is a open-source version control system (VCS), a tool that manages the changes of files in a project. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change, making it easy to revert back to previous versions of the file if you make a mistake or accidentally break something. Versions can be branched and later re-merged, allowing a mainline version of the code and side versions for development and testing.  Version control systems (VCS) are most commonly used for source code management, but Git is flexible and almost any type of files can be managed using a VCS. There are other version control systems on the market today (e.g., Mercurial, Subversion); Git is among the most popular. Git operates by having distributed project ‘repositories’ that store your code.

Github is a company that provides web-based Git repository hosting. Github manages the servers used to store your project repositories, supports all git features such as branches, merges, and commits, as well as adding additional tools that facilitate project development and collaboration, e.g. wiki hosting and issue tracking. There are other git hosting platforms as well: Bitbucket, Gitlab, CodePlex, and Google’s Cloud Source Repositories, etc.
