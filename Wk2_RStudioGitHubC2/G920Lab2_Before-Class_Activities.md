# Things to Do Before Class


### Create GitHub Account and Send Username To Instructors
Please do this first, so that you can access course materials that we are posting the course GitHub page.
[GitHub](https://www.github.com)

### Install/Update R
Please ensure that your version of R is 3.5.x or later.  During workshops in summer 2018, we ran into package update bugs when earlier versions of R were used.

### Install RStudio
[RStudio Website](https://www.rstudio.com/)

### Install R Packages
List of packages likely will be updated over time, but here's a starter.  Suggestions welcome for additional packages.
+analogue
+dplyr
+jsonlite
+ggplot2
+markdown
+neotoma
+pagan
+rioja
+shiny  
+vegan

I prefer to add packages in RStudio, but up to you.
