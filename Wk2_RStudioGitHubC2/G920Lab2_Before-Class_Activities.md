### Lab 2:  Introduction to R, RStudio, GitHub

### Things to Do Before Class


#### Create GitHub Account and Send Username To Instructors
Please do this first, so that you can access course materials that we are posting the course GitHub page.

[GitHub Webpage](https://www.github.com)

#### Install/Update R
Please ensure that your version of R is 3.5.x or later.  During workshops in summer 2018, we ran into package update bugs when earlier versions of R were used.

[R Project Webpage](https://www.r-project.org/)

#### Install RStudio
Not required, but recommended: RStudio offers a useful GUI  for working with R scripts, files, packages, etc. [RStudio Website](https://www.rstudio.com/)

#### Install R Packages
List of packages likely will be updated over time, but here's a starter.  Suggestions welcome for additional packages.

*analogue, bchron, clam, dplyr, jsonlite, geochron, ggplot2, markdown, neotoma, pagan, palaeoSig, rbacon, rioja, shiny, vegan*

I prefer to add packages in RStudio, but up to you.

#### Install Git on your Computer
